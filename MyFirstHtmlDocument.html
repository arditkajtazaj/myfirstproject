    <h3>History </h3>
    <p>
        <b>Real Madrid</b>'s origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza,<br>
        which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid,<br>
        playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football <sup>[1]</sup><del>(New Society of Football)</del>,<br>
        to distinguish themselves from Sky Football.<i> Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, \<br>
        latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid.</i> <em>In 1901, this new club was renamed as <ins>Madrid Football Club</ins>.</em> Later, following a restructuring in 1902,<br>
        Sky was renamed as "New Foot-Ball Club".On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.<br>
        The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. <br>
        They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes,<br>
        and thought the new club should embody that idea. <b>The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted.</b><br>
        The membership fee was also set, two <abbr title="Old Spanish Currency">pesetas</abbr> a month,<i>and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white</i> in honor of a famous English team Corinthian F.C.,<br>
        which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.
